chore: migrate the toolchain to TypeScript 7

Bump the `typescript` devDependency from `6.x` to `7.x` (the native compiler) across the workspace, and bump `tsdown` `0.22.3` → `0.22.7` so its peer range accepts `typescript@^7`.

This is a build-time-only change with **no integration impact**: `typescript` is a devDependency (never a peer/runtime dependency), so consumers' own TypeScript version is untouched, and `.d.ts`/`.js` emit is handled by tsdown (Rolldown + OXC isolated declarations), not `tsc`. `tsc --noEmit` type-checks cleanly on TS 7 with zero source changes, and the public type surface is semantically identical (a rebuild only reformats declaration whitespace/comments via the newer `rolldown-plugin-dts` printer). Safe to ship as a minor.
